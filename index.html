<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me.</h3>

<p>My name is Amy and I'm new around here. I'm taking my first steps in the world of Computer Science, picking up and learning new things as I go.</p>

<p>I am a second year PhD student within the <a href="https://mrl.nott.ac.uk/">Mixed Reality Laboratory</a> research group at the <a href="http://nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a>. My previous undergraduate studies were based in Audio and Recording Technologies at <a href="http://dmu.ac.uk/">De Montfort University</a> in Leicester and my goal is to better understand interactions with Digital Musical Instruments. </p>

<p>In addition to my studies I am passionate about learning and development, I support my community through my involvement with the hobbyist hacking and programming society <a href="https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/">HackSoc</a> as the Outreach and Inclusivity Secretary. As part of this role, I lead the organisation for the <a href="http://inspirewit.com/">Women in Technology</a> community conference event, which is free for all to attend and promotes gender inclusivity by showcasing women in technical roles and hosting workshops that teach our attendees new skills from ideation of projects to learning how to code.  </p>

<a id="research" class="anchor" href="#research" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research.</h3>

<p>The title for my PhD research is <em>Gesture Controlled Sound in Facilitated Performance for Users with Complex Disabilities</em>. This has led to my involvement in projects such at the <a href="http://www.orchestraslive.org.uk/news/able-orchestra/">Able Orchestra</a>, the BBC Proms and the <a href="http://www.semanticaudio.ac.uk/news/able-orchestra-project/">Fusing Audio and Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Music Production and Consumption</a> project. </p>

<p>Currently my research focus is on developing greater understanding of Digital Musical Instruments in Facilitated Performance through the analysis of qualitative data gathered during the Able Orchestra project. </p>

<p>As well as my own research, I am part of the voluntary <a href="https://github.com/campus-experts">GitHub Campus Experts</a> program, which involves fostering the development of open source learning in university communities. I am also assisting in the practical research of Music Therapy in Dementia Care through a postgraduate research placement with <a href="http://mha.org.uk/">MHA</a>. </p>

<p>Previously I have assisted in Schools through <a href="http://exchange.nottingham.ac.uk/blog/puzzles-robots-and-raspberry-pi-computer-science-activity-day-at-firbeck-academy/?platform=hootsuite/">ICT Wow days</a> organised by the University of Nottingham Outreach; additionally I have volunteered as a classroom assistant for the Nottingham <a href="http://techmums.co/">TechMums</a> project with Dr Sue Black. Currently I am completing training in order to become a local <a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a> volunteer. </p>

<a id="hackathons--projects" class="anchor" href="#hackathons--projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hackathons &amp; Projects.</h3>

<p>My experience of hackathons began through being a member of the <a href="http://hacksocnotts.co.uk">HackSoc</a> society and joining their annual Hackathon - <a href="http://hacknotts.com">HackNotts</a> - in November 2015, where I was awarded the Bloomberg prize of most awesome hack for my project <a href="https://devpost.com/software/interactive-leap-audio">Interactive Leap Audio</a>. </p>

<p>Since November 2015 I have attended several student and community hackathons, as well as other <a href="http://mlh.io">Major League Hacking</a> events including: BanterHack 2016, TechNottingham's Hack24, HackCon EU 2016, JacobsHack 2016, Hackference 2016, BrumHack &amp; Rebel Makers Club 2016, AstonHack 2016 and OxfordHack 2016 - with plans to continue to engage in many more this season! </p>

<p>I created my GitHub profile in January 2016 and since then I have worked on a small number of repositories. I am currently spending time developing my knowledge of web development, coding and open source practices in the hope that I can contribute to this community more as I build on my skills. </p>
